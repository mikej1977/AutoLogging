# AutoLogging

Deforestation Simulator

Updated for B42
The select interface will get a glow-up when I have more time. I just wanted to get this out there for y'all. 42 has been updated with extra features. I'll get to 41 as soon as I can.

Fast Forward should stick now in B42 until you're done OR until a zombie gets a good whiff of you.

Adds a Right-Click Logging Menu

Identify Tree [41] [42]
Gather Logs [41] [42]
Gather Twigs and Branches [42]
Clear Trees [41] [42]
Clear Bushes [42]
Cut Grass [42]


Identify Tree: Choose a tree and your player will tell you what tree it is.

Gather Logs: Select a spot to put your logs first, then select an area and you will gather every log in that area and take them to selected spot. You will only pick up as many logs as you can carry, drop them off and go back for more.

Gather Twigs and Branches Select a spot to put your gathered twigs and branches, then select an area and you will gather all twigs, branches, saplings, etc and take them to the selected spot.

Clear Trees: Select an area and you will chop down every tree in that area. This option will not appear if don't have an axe.

Clear Bushes Clear bushes in an area.

Cut Grass Clear grass and weeds in an area. I did not make an automatic drop off for the "clippings."

Also, if you're an Axeman / Lumberjack, trees will have 20% less health so chop-chopping should be 

Known issues: The path finding is still weird sometimes. It needed to be quick, and it is, but it's also really dirty. If you select a "large" area, the game may hang while it figures out how best to chop em or gather em.

Works with MP on 41 and SP. Everything is client side. There are some checks done by vanilla PZ in case multiple players try picking up the same item.

If anything goes wrong, it should fail gracefully.
This is a WIP and things will be added.
